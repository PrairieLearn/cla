# PrairieLearn CLA

Like many open source projects, we ask that you sign our [Contributor License Agreement](./CLA.md) before we can accept your contribution.
PrairieLearn's Contributor License Agreement.

We use [`cla-assistant/github-action`](https://github.com/cla-assistant/github-action) to check for and store signature information. The signature information can be found in this repository in the [`signatures.json`](./signatures.json) file.

## Email signatures

Some folks who contributed before the CLA was established were contacted via email and asked to sign the CLA. Their signatures can be found in the `emails` directory.
